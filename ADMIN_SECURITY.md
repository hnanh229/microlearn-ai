# ðŸ”’ Admin Panel Security Configuration

## Overview
The admin panel files have been removed from the public repository for security reasons. This prevents unauthorized access to admin functionality and protects sensitive administrative code.

## Files Excluded from Repository

### Frontend Admin Files
- `frontend/src/pages/admin/` - All admin page components
- `frontend/src/components/admin/` - Admin layout and components  
- `frontend/src/services/adminService.js` - Admin API service

### Backend Admin Files
- `backend/src/routes/adminRoutes.js` - Admin API routes
- `backend/src/controllers/adminController.js` - Admin business logic
- `backend/src/middleware/adminAuth.js` - Admin authentication middleware
- `backend/src/scripts/initAdmin.js` - Admin user initialization script

## Security Benefits
âœ… Admin functionality is not exposed in public repository  
âœ… Prevents unauthorized code analysis of admin features  
âœ… Protects admin authentication mechanisms  
âœ… Reduces attack surface for potential security vulnerabilities  

## For Developers
If you need to work with admin functionality:

1. **Contact the project maintainer** for access to admin files
2. **Keep admin files in a private repository** or secure location
3. **Never commit admin files** to public repositories
4. **Use environment variables** for admin credentials
5. **Deploy admin files separately** from main application

## Admin Panel Access
- Local Development: `http://localhost:5173/admin/login`
- Production: `https://hnanh229.github.io/microlearn-ai/admin/login`

## Note
The admin panel still exists and functions normally in your local development environment. Only the source code has been excluded from the public repository.

**Important**: Keep this security configuration in place to maintain the integrity and security of your admin panel.
